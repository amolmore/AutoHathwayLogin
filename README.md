# Auto Hathway Login 

This is a small script that will log you in automatically if Hathway logs you out. Hathway logs you out every few hours and this is very annoying while downloading huge files

Usage:

'''
python AutoHathwayLogin.py <username> <password> <sleep time in seconds>

'''

Where username is your hathway email, password is your password and sleeo time is the time between 2 consecutive internet connectivity tests. You can alternatively save username and password in the variables in the file and simply run by typing

'''
python AutoHathwayLogin.py
